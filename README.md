# Modelling Cards

This repository contains files that describe a card and a deck of cards, using a **Card** class *(in class.py)* and a **Deck** class *(in deck.py)*.  The *main.py* file creates a deck of cards and modifies it using the methods provided in the Deck class.  The *main.py* file also contains functions that analyze a hand of cards and determines whether it is a **flush** or a **straight**.

## Task

1. **Download this repository** using the **green button** located in the top right corner of your browser window.
2. Extract the folder from the zip file that was downloaded and open it up in ***Visual Studio Code***.  You can open an entire folder using the File Menu at the top of your screen.
3. Edit the **class.py** file.  Your task is to complete the functions called **bottom()**, **shuffle()**, and **sort()**.  You will be doing this in partners, so talk about what type of algorithm would be appropriate in each case.  You can then pick a function to code yourself.  For example, you might work on the **shuffle()** function and your partner might work on the ***sort()*** function.  When you are finished we will talk about how to combine your changes together into one file without typing out the code twice.
