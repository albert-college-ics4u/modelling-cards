# Modelling Cards

This repository contains files that describe a card and a deck of cards, using a **Card** class *(in class.py)* and a **Deck** class *(in deck.py)*.  The *main.py* file creates a deck of cards and modifies it using the methods provided in the Deck class.  The *main.py* file also contains functions that analyze a hand of cards and determines whether it is a **flush** or a **straight**.
